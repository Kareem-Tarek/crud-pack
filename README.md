# CRUD Pack

CRUD Pack is a **blueprint-first Laravel CRUD generator** that allows developers to scaffold complete CRUD resources (Web or API) using a single Artisan command, while strictly following Laravel conventions.

It is designed to eliminate repetitive boilerplate **without hiding logic**, **without magic**, and **without locking developers into abstractions**. Everything generated by CRUD Pack is readable, editable, and intended to be owned and customized by the developer.

CRUD Pack includes first-class support for:

- Soft deletes
- Bulk operations
- Deleted listings
- Restore workflows
- Force-delete workflows

All delete-related behavior is implemented in a **shared, reusable way**, ensuring consistency across the entire application.

## Why CRUD Pack Exists

Most Laravel CRUD generators fall into one of two categories:

1. **Overly magical generators**  
   These hide logic, abstract behavior too aggressively, and make customization difficult.

2. **Minimal stub generators**  
   These save very little time and leave all real-world concerns to the developer.

CRUD Pack intentionally sits between these two extremes.

It generates a **complete, real-world CRUD blueprint** that:

- Follows Laravel conventions strictly
- Handles real application needs (soft deletes, bulk actions, restore flows)
- Keeps all logic explicit and visible
- Encourages customization instead of hiding behavior

The goal is **speed without sacrificing control**.
