# CRUD Pack

CRUD Pack is a **blueprint-first Laravel CRUD generator** that allows developers to scaffold complete CRUD resources (Web or API) using a single Artisan command, while strictly following Laravel conventions.

It is designed to eliminate repetitive boilerplate **without hiding logic**, **without magic**, and **without locking developers into abstractions**. Everything generated by CRUD Pack is readable, editable, and intended to be owned and customized by the developer.

CRUD Pack includes first-class support for:

- Soft deletes
- Bulk operations
- Deleted listings
- Restore workflows
- Force-delete workflows

All delete-related behavior is implemented in a **shared, reusable way**, ensuring consistency across the entire application.

## Why CRUD Pack Exists

Most Laravel CRUD generators fall into one of two categories:

1. **Overly magical generators**  
   These hide logic, abstract behavior too aggressively, and make customization difficult.

2. **Minimal stub generators**  
   These save very little time and leave all real-world concerns to the developer.

CRUD Pack intentionally sits between these two extremes.

It generates a **complete, real-world CRUD blueprint** that:

- Follows Laravel conventions strictly
- Handles real application needs (soft deletes, bulk actions, restore flows)
- Keeps all logic explicit and visible
- Encourages customization instead of hiding behavior

The goal is **speed without sacrificing control**.

## Requirements

- **PHP:** 8.0 or higher
- **Laravel:** 8.x and above  
  - Developed and tested on **Laravel 11 and Laravel 12**
  - Fully compatible with Laravel 8+

## Installation

```bash
composer require kareemtarek/crud-pack
```

## Core Concept
CRUD Pack is centered around one single Artisan command and one resource name.

From that resource name, CRUD Pack automatically derives everything else according to Laravel conventions, including:
- Model names
- Table names
- Controller classes
- Route URIs and route names
- View directories
- Variable names

This guarantees:
- Consistency across the application
- Predictable structure
- Zero naming ambiguity
---
## Command Overview
```bash
php artisan crud:make ResourceName
```
This command always generates a "controller" (wether web or api) and can optionally generate:
- Routes
- Eloquent model
- Migration
- Request validation
- Policy
- Blade views (Web controllers only)

The command requires two mandatory decisions and supports optional generators through flags or an interactive wizard.

## Resource Name Rules
The resource name is the foundation of everything CRUD Pack generates and must strictly follow Laravel conventions.

### Rules
- Must be singular
- Must be StudlyCase
- Must NOT include suffixes like Controller, Model, Request, etc.

### Valid Examples
```bash
php artisan crud:make Category
php artisan crud:make Product
php artisan crud:make ProductCategory

```
### Invalid Examples
```bash
php artisan crud:make categories
php artisan crud:make category
php artisan crud:make product_categories

```
From this single resource name, CRUD Pack dynamically derives:
| Item              | Result                                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Model             | ```bash App\Models\Category ```                         |
| Table             | ```bash categories ```                                  |
| Controller (Web)  | ```bash App\Http\Controllers\CategoryController ```     |
| Controller (API)  | ```bash App\Http\Controllers\Api\CategoryController ``` |
| Route URI         | ```bash /categories ```                                 |
| Route names       | ```bash categories.* ```                                |
| Variables         | ```bash $category, $categories ```                      |
| Views folder      | ```bash resources/views/categories ```                  |
